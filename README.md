# Analyis Pipeline for Boltz2 Multimer Predictions
This is a Snakemake pipeline to quickly analyse large sets of multimeric predictions generated by Boltz2.

## Dependencies
This pipeline requires and will automatically install (if necessary) the `ipsae.py` from the [IPSAE repository](https://github.com/DunbrackLab/IPSAE). A big thanks to Professor Roland Dunbrack Jr for his work on developing this metric ([bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.10.637595 )).
